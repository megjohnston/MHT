# MHT

The Mental Health Triage App was made for my dissertation at Queen's University Belfast in 2020.

The Mental Health Triage (MHT) web application is a tool for individuals, to be referred to as “clients”, to complete an informal assessment to gauge their wellbeing. This is accomplished using an embodied relational agent approach (ERA) for a conversational feel. Resources are recommended, in part, according to specific outcomes, or “turns” in the dialogue, and other resources and features can be found along the navigation bar at the top of the application. These other features include a day planner and additional resources for nutrition, sleep, and managing stress. The application was developed primarily using HTML, JavaScript, PHP, CSS (specifically Bootstrap framework), and JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).
